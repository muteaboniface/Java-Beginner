+ Classes are the building blocks of programs built using the object oriented methodology
+ objects
    + state
    + Behaviour



+ class composition
    +Variables that hold data specific to a particular object
        + fields
        + member variables
        + instance variables
        +

    + Member / Instance methods
        + perform operations on objects and are defined inside the class


    + Static or class fields
        + common to any object within the same class
        + exist only once irregardless of total number of objects

    + static or class methods
        + DO NOT AFFECT SPECIFIC OBJECTS IN THE CLASS


    + Inner classes
        + At times a class is defined inside a class

+ Private members
    + Can be variables or methods
    + Only referenced within definitions of member methods

+ Constructors
    + A constructorâ€™s name must be the same as the name of the class it is declared in.
    + cannot return a value

    + Default constructor
