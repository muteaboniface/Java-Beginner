Member methods
    are declared where the class is defined. The methods are a member of the class within
    which they are written. These methods are also used to access the private parts of the
    class and help us perform various actions on an object through them.


Setters and Getters
    + PRIVATE members can be accessed outside a class

    + public methods are used instead to set values to private members and access them directly
    +  Setters - set
    + Getters - Get



+ Inheritance
    + creating a new class from an existing class
    + Superclass -  Parentclass
    + Derived Class - subclass/child class

    ////  Keyword extend is used ////

    + An object of the derived class “is an” object of the base class or the parent class
    + A derived object has all characteristics of the parent class.


    /// Some classes cannot be inherited and have the keyword final ////

    + A subclass can only inherit from one parent for simplicity
    +

    + Class access specifiers
        + public - object of derived is an object of the super class
        + protected - more restrictive than public, but allows derivations
        + private - prevents objects of the derived class to be treated as objects of the super class


        + Super keyword
            + allows the derived class to access members of its super class
            coz the "this" keyword is used to access members of its own class.
