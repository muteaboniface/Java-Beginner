    An array is a collection of similar data types in a sequenced format

    members of an array - array elements
     + length of an array
        + arrayName.length
    + Indexing
        + zero to length-1
    + During the declaration of an array one must specify
        + datatype, name and size


    + Array declaration
        + int [] myArray;
        + int []myArray;
        + int myArray[]; c-style declaration

    + Array Instantiation
        + specifying size to allocate in memory
        + new keyword used
            + int [] myArray = new int[5];


    + Array initialization
        + Assigning array elements
        + int [] myArray = {1,3,5,6,7,3};

    + [] - indicates that a variable is an array when declaring it
    + [] - read/ write from/to



    + int arrays
    + char arrays
    + string arrays
    + called and calling methods
        + primitive data types are not modified by the called method


+ Smart loops
    + take the form of for(int i : array) where the length of the array is referenced and loop incremented by 1
